## Overview

Although you can simply deploy your application with eksctl like the instruction we provide [here](eksctl/01_setup.md), the price of EKS is not cheap. This instruction will let you use simple EC2 instance and minikube to deploy your application.

## Estimated Price

TODO: The estimated price is not yet confirmed yet. Write here.
