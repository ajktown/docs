# Ritual Group Domain


## Overview

Ritual Group Domain is a domain that manages rituals and action groups. It is responsible for creating a new default ritual if the user does not have any rituals yet.


## Action Groups & Archived Action Groups

Users can archive their action groups once they no longer need them. Archived action group does not mean they are private or hidden. They are just no longer managed by the user. The user can unarchive them if they need them again.

Ritual Group smartly filters out the archived action groups based on the requester's request.
