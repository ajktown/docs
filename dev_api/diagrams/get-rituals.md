# Get Rituals API


## Overview

Sequence diagram for `AJK Town API` endpoint: `GET /api/v1/rituals`


## Notice

Although the API returns `rituals` (or plural), AJK Town only supports one ritual at a time. The API will return the only ritual that AJK Town supports.
This is intended for future updates where users can have multiple rituals, but for now, only one ritual (default) is supported.
